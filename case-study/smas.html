            <h5>The Client.</h5>
            <p>Springfield Mid-America Singers (SMAS) is a large choral ensemble performance non-profit. Called together by their love of singing, they are devoted to enriching the community through excellence in choral music. Central goals include involving people in choral music as a community, teaching singing as a life-long activity, and artistically expressing and uplifting the human spirit through choral music.</p>
            <h5>The Problem.</h5>
            <p>As SMAS entered into the 2016-2017 season, they were looking for a way to enhance their goals. Since they had no one updating their current site, many people were missing vital information. We needed to make the site easy to update and change. Bringing in a younger audience was also important as they reache closer to their 50th anniversary. With time they hope reaching out them will also bring in more singers. The site needed to be built with the audience in mind - easy, convient, and simple for visitors. </p>
            <h5>The Solution.</h5>
            <p>The final solution was to build a fully responsive web design. It includes front page ‘call-to-actions’ (CTA) which point users to the concert season and news sections. When audition season comes back around, Summer 2017, then the website will display a full front-page advertisement and specific CTA. They also hired me to maintain their website as a way to constantly keep it up-to-date. They are already seeing a higher percentage of advertising sales (by using the website as a reference) than any other year, as well as, above average turn-out for the 2016 audtions.</p>
